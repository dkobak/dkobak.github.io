**Update (May):** this paper has [been published in *Significance*](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2018.01141.x). This is a follow-up to our 2016 *Significance* paper [*Statistical fingerprints of electoral fraud?*](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00936.x) which itself was a popular companion paper to a more formal 2016 *AOAS* paper [*Integer percentages as electoral falsification fingerprints*](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1458909907).
